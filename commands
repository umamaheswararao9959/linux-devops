===============================================================================================================================================

1) ls    --> list all the files and directories (ls)
   ls -lrt --> ls= list, lrt= long recursive time.
   ll --> long list.

2) pwd   --> to display present working directory, (pwd)

3) cd    --> change directory from one directory to another directory (cd directory name)

4) mv    -->  it is used for rename of file name ordirectory (mv old file name new file name)
   mv    -->  it is used to move a file or directory from one place to another place, (mv sourcefile targetfile)
   
5) mkdir --> it is used to create a new directory (mkdir directory name)

6) du -h --> to find the size of the file (du-h file name) or disk usage
             du--> its display disk utilization , h--> it is a human readable format.
 
7) df    --> (disk file system) it is used to display the disk space used in the file system

8) chmod --> change the access mode of a file or directory permission to read,write,exicution (chmod -R *** filename).
             R ---> recursively = repetedly.
             u ---> owner of the file
             g ---> it reprsents group, apply to all members of group.
             o ---> owners who r not members of group or owner.
             a ---> those who r all of the above.
             r ---> only read
             w ---> only write
             x ---> only exicution

9) find        --->it  will search our file in all directoris and it will gives the location of the file 
                        (find /var/log/nginx -type f -name '*.log.gz') (example:  find /home/ec2-user/dir "file name")
   find and disply    ---> find -type f -name "filename" -exec ls -lrt{}\;
   find and remove    ---> find -type f -name "filename" -exec rm -rf{}\;
                   to find specific size of the file in a directory --->  find  /dirname/ -type -f -size +100mb -exec cp -nv {} target path \;

10) ssh command     --> it is a protocol used to securily connect to a (host) remote server/system. 
          	        it transfer the data in encrypted form between the host and client (ssh -i redhat.pem ec2-user@public ip)

11) scp(secure copy)--> it is used to copy a file between two servers in a secure way. 
		        its allows secure transfering of files in between local host and remote host(scp -i pemfile sourcefile.txt destination@ip address)	
                        ( scp filename b.umamaheswararao@ip:/home/                                  (scp -i pemfile -rp source path destination path) 
12) find ip address --> ifconfig -a (it displaying current network configuration in formation) or (ip addr show)

13) find flavour of linux --> cat /etc/os-release

14) kill      --> it is used to terminated process manually. this command sends a signal to a process which is terminates the process
			( kill -9 process id)

15) crontab   -->  it is used for the job scheduler.(* * * * * source path > target path) after that u can give (sh source path > target path)
				min   houre   date of month    month   day of week   path	

16) sudo      --> create user as a root permission(sudo filename). switch to root user from ec2-user.(sudo su -)
              -->   /etc/groups  --- root:root filename or directory name
              -->   /etc/sudoers --- root:<all> <all> (root permisions)

17) ps -ef    --> it is used to list the currently running processes, processid (ps --> process status)
                (if check particular process is running or not then use ps -ef | grep "process id" or "process name" )

18) zip       --> it is used to compress the file and reduce the file size and used as a file package utility, if u want to transfer the file 
                  faster, then ZIP the file and transfer. ( gzip filename)	uncompress ----> (gzip -d file.gz or gunzip file.gz)

19) grep      --> it is used for filter the content of a file which makes our search easy grep with pipe (grep -v<word> <file name>) (GLOBAL REGULAR EXPRESSION PRINT) 

20) | pipe    --> it is used to combine two or more commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command,
                  and this command's output may act as input to the next

21) tar       --> it is used to create archive and extract the archive files. we can use linux tar command to create compressed or uncompressed 
                  archive files and also maintain, modified. ( tar -cvzf filename.tar sourcefile.zip, uncompress---> tar -xvzf filename.tar)

22) creating user: sudo useradd name
                   sudo passwd username 

23) man command ---> The man command displays the ‘man pages’ or user manual a command. (man command name)
                     It is advantages as the programmer who is new to commands will have a better understanding before executing any Linux commands.

24) cat cammand ---> It is short for ‘concatenate’ and permits users to create files, redirect output, list the contents of a file, 
                     and even concatenate multiple files.

25) touch ---> it is used for creating empty files. (touch file1 file2 ...)

26) top   ---> to disply cpu utilization memory, login id.

27) crul  ---> it is a command-line tool to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols 
	      (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP, or FILE). 
              This tool is preferred for automation since it is designed to work without user interaction. curl can transfer multiple files at once.
              (curl https://www.geeksforgeeks.org,   curl http://site.{one, two, three}.com ).

28) chown --> to change the ownership of file or group (sudo chown -R root:root file name)

29) cat /etc/passwd --> to see the list of users

30) findmnt  --> to see the mounted files on our system (findmnt -l) or (findmnt --fstab /mnt/external/disk2) find a filesystem using a mount point.

31) head            --> it will display top 10 (or) first 10 lines of the file (head filename)

32) tail            --> it will display last 10 lines of the file (tail filename)

38) hostname        --> display host name

39) hostname -i     --> display hostname ip

40) wc              --> given numbers,words,characters available in the file content (wc file name)
                         number of lines
                         number of words
                         number of characters

41) uniq            --> remove duplicates of file contnent/ it can remove only continuos duplicates (uniq file name)

42) sed -->  replace,searching, deleting words in the file( cat filename | sed 's/any word/replace word/'  or cat filename | sed 's/any word/replace word/g')

43) yum ---> The yum command is the primary tool for getting, installing, deleting, querying, and otherwise managing Red Hat Enterprise
                  Linux RPM software packages from official Red Hat software repositories, as well as other third-party repositories

44) du -skx * | sort -n --> to see which files are tacking more memory in sequential order.

MAVEN:           --> it is a open source tool buildupon a java language
                 --> maven is a java build tool, maven reads pom.xml files and executes the goals.

pre-requisities: ---> java, maven installation packages.

maven is a plugin based tool,
pom.xml          --> it is used to build the projects. it contains information of project and configuration information for the maven
                     such as dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source directory, plugins, goals etc...
pom              --> project object model.
<group id>       --> organization name or company name,
<artifact id>    --> application name/jar name
<version>        --> version of the jar file.
<packages>       --> jar/war/ear files.

MAVEN HAVING 3 STANDARD BUILD LIFE CYCLES:
1.clean
2.deafult/build
3.site

clean           --> remove/delete target folders
              (removing temporary files from the output directory, including generated source files, compiled classes and previous JAR files)

default/build  :- a) resources  --> dowload the resources
                  b) compile    --> compile the java code
                  c) test       --> run the unit test cases
                     verify     -->
                  d) package    --> jar/war/ear packages will be created
                  e) install    --> copy jar/war/ear packages to local repositiry
                  f) deploy     --> uploade jar/war/ear files to remote repository

site            --> generate project documents/reports.(create fresh documentation to create reports, deploy site, etc...)

dot class files           --> while compile the java code to generate the dot class files.(It contains bytecode, which is binary program code)
jar(java archive)files                --> group of dot files is a jar files.
war(web application archive) files    --> group of jar files, like war.xml,metadata,web.info.
ear(enterprice archive) files         --> group of war files, like csc(casecading stylesheet, html,cij)


MAVEN HAS 3 REPOSITORIES:
1. LOCAL repository   --> c:/user/username/.m2/repository(user path)Local repositories are the folders or directory on your local machine that 
                          contains the catched jars and dependencies required by your project and other artifacts that are built by you.

2. CENTRAL repository --> (http:repo.mvn.org) is available for downloading the dependencies in your maven project and also to release 
                          the artifacts that you want to on the central repository. 
 
3. REMOTE repository  --> (artifactory or nexus) The remote repositories are the resources that are located remotely and contain directory 
                          having jars, library files, and plugins, and other artifacts that might be useful and are accessed by using the 
                          protocols such as https:// of file:// protocol. 

 MAVEN PLUGINS:
  
  build plugins: mvn-resource-plugins
                 mvn-compile-plugins
                 mvn-packege-plugins
                 mvn-istall-plugins
                 mvn-deploy-plugins
